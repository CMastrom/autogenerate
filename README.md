# autogenerate
This tiny but efficient C program allows you to autogenerate code in your program files. It can be used to autogenerate PHP, HTML 5, Bootstrap, C, and others very soon! 

Create an alias to wherever you put the gen executable (not the gen.c file) called 'gen', and whenever you want to generate some code in a given file, just simply navigate to the files directory in Terminal and run 'gen file_name.file_extension'.
If you are a windows user, you might have to re-compile the source C code to be able to use, and then create an alias pointing to that gen executable. That is why I uploaded the gen executable (potentially only compiled for MAC) and gen.c source file (can be compiled to anything).
